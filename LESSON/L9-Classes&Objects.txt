OBEJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING:

    step by step : procedural oriented approach.(in case of C)
    -> There was lagging: not flexible
                          no proper arrangement
                          time consuming

-> So, Object Oriented Programming was introduced:
    it is a rule to follow when we build application
