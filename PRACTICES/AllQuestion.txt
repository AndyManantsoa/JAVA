Create a class called "Book" with the following attributes:
title (String)
author (String)
numberOfPages (int)
Write a program that:
* Defines the Book class with the mentioned attributes.
* Creates two objects (instances) of the Book class with different book information.
* Prints the details of each book object (title, author, number of pages) using appropriate methods or by accessing the attributes directly.

Create a class called "Calculator" with the following methods:
add(int a, int b) - This method takes two integers and returns their sum.
subtract(int a, int b) - This method takes two integers and returns their difference.
Write a program that:
* Defines the Calculator class with the mentioned methods.
* Creates an object of the Calculator class.
* Calls the add and subtract methods with different numbers and prints the results.

Create a class called "Student" with the following attributes:
name (String)
grade (char)
Write a program that:
* Defines the Student class with the mentioned attributes.
* Creates two objects of the Student class with different student information (name and grade).
* Add a method to the Student class called displayDetails that prints the student's name and grade.
* Calls the displayDetails method on each student object.

Create a class called "Fan" with the following attributes:
speed (int) - This can be a value from 1 (slow) to 3 (fast)
on (boolean) - Indicates whether the fan is on or off
Write a program that:
* Defines the Fan class with the mentioned attributes.
* Creates an object of the Fan class with initial values for speed and on state.
* Add methods to the Fan class for:
* turnOn - Sets the on attribute to true.
* turnOff - Sets the on attribute to false.
* increaseSpeed - Increases the speed by 1 (if the speed is already 3, it stays at 3).
* decreaseSpeed - Decreases the speed by 1 (if the speed is already 1, it stays at 1).
* Use the defined methods to change the fan's state (on/off) and speed.
* Print the current state (on/off) and speed of the fan after each change.

Create a class called "Circle" with the following attribute:
radius (double)
Write a program that:
* Defines the Circle class with the mentioned attribute.
* Add a method to the Circle class called calculateArea that calculates the area of the circle (pi * radius^2) and returns the result.
* Create an object of the Circle class with a specific radius value.
* Call the calculateArea method on the circle object and print the calculated area.
