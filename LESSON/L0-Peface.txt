JVM & JRE & JVM:
----------------


JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
    -> The JVM is a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode (.class files) on a computer.
    -> It's the runtime environment for Java, responsible for executing Java programs.
    ->The JVM provides a layer of abstraction between the Java code and the underlying operating system, 
        allowing Java programs to be platform-independent.
    ->The JVM is responsible for tasks like memory management, security, and optimization.
    
JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
    ->The JRE is a package that includes the JVM, as well as other libraries and utilities necessary to run Java programs.
    ->It provides the environment in which Java programs can run, including the JVM, core classes, and supporting files.
    ->The JRE is essentially a bundle of the JVM and other essential components, making it possible to run Java applications on a computer.
    T->he JRE is available for download and installation on its own, allowing users to run Java programs without needing to develop 
        or compile Java code.
    
JDK (Java Development Kit):
    ->The JDK is a package that includes the JRE, as well as development tools and libraries necessary to develop, compile, 
        and run Java programs.
    ->It provides everything you need to develop, test, and run Java applications, including the JRE, compiler (javac),
        debugger, and other development tools.
    ->The JDK is designed for Java developers, providing the necessary tools to create, compile, and package Java applications.
    ->The JDK is typically used by developers, while the JRE is used by end-users who only need to run Java applications.
    
    
In summary:


    JVM: The virtual machine that runs Java bytecode.
    JRE: A package that includes the JVM and other essential components to run Java programs.
    JDK: A package that includes the JRE, as well as development tools and libraries to develop, compile, and run Java programs.
    
    Here's a simple analogy to help you remember the difference:
        JVM is like a car engine.
        JRE is like a car with an engine, but without the tools to build or repair it.
        JDK is like a car with an engine, plus a garage with tools to build, repair, and customize the car.
