CONSTRUCTOR:
------------
    It is a specific type of method in java which is used to create the instance of a class or initialize
    the memory for instance variable.

    Rule for define constructor :
        -> It doesn't have any return type that's why it is called special.
        -> It must have the same name as the class name.
        -> It can have parameters or not.
        -> It can get called implicitly when we are initialing the object/ creating the object for particular class.

    Type of constructor:
        -> Default constructor/non parametrized constructor.
        -> Parameterized constructor.

        Default constructor: we don't need to define default constructor explicitely due to it's defined implicitely by the java compiler 
        after creating the class.
        Parameterized constructor: it is mainly used for initialize the properties value for instance variable.
