| COLLECTION FRAMEWORK |
+----------------------+

-> The Collection Framework in Java is a set of classes and interfaces that provide a way to store 
    and manipulate collections of objects. It provides a standardized way of representing and working 
    with collections, making it easier to write robust and efficient code.

-> Key Interfaces and Classes:
    1. Collection Interface
        The Collection interface is the root interface of the Collection Framework.
        It defines the basic operations that can be performed on a collection, such as add, remove, contains, and size.

    2. List Interface
        The List interface extends the Collection interface.
        It provides additional methods for working with ordered collections, such as get, set, and indexOf.

    3. Set Interface
        The Set interface extends the Collection interface.
        It provides methods for working with unordered collections, such as add and contains.

    4. Map Interface
        The Map interface is not a subclass of Collection, but it is often used in conjunction with collections.
        It provides methods for working with key-value pairs, such as put, get, and containsKey.

    5. ArrayList Class
        The ArrayList class is a popular implementation of the List interface.
        It provides a resizable array-based implementation of a list.

    6. LinkedList Class
        The LinkedList class is another implementation of the List interface.
        It provides a linked-list-based implementation of a list.

    7. HashSet Class
        The HashSet class is an implementation of the Set interface.
        It provides a hash-based implementation of a set.
        
    8. HashMap Class
        The HashMap class is an implementation of the Map interface.
        It provides a hash-based implementation of a map.
