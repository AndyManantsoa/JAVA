Definitions:

-> Exception is an unwanted event which occurs at the run time of the program and break the normal flow of execution
-> Exception handling is a mechanism to handle the runtime errors throuh custom message

    -> Parent class of all exception are all throwable class


                                   throwable
                              ___________________

                    * Unchecked exeption         - error

-> Throwable class inherits mainly 2 childs exeption class known as exception and error
-> Exception class is inherited by checheck and unchecked exception's classes

2) Unchecked exception / runtime exception:
    Exception which occurs bat the run time of the program
ex: Arithmetic exception
    NullPointer exception
