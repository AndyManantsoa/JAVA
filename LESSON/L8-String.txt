-> String is the sequence of character or an array of characters.
        ex: - String s ="abc";
            - to convert char into String:
                Char []a={'a','b','c'}; -> String s = new String(a); SOP(s)->abc

-> We define string values always inside double quotes.

-> In java, String is an object.

-> to create a string we can create:
    - By litteral: can be created by the help of double quotes (String a = "abc")
    - By new keyword

litteral:
________

    -> In java, the string values are store inside a special memory space know as string constraint pool
        it is inside the heap memory only.

        Heap Memory

    -> In java, when we create a string with the help of litterals, in that case JVM checks verytime the value inside string 
        constraint pool if the value is already present inside the pool, in such case, new instance will reffer to the same object/value
        in case of primitive data type. any variable created will be alocate in different memory.
        but in case of String, if we create two variables with the same values

    -> Advantage of litteral String:
        it in hance the memory management for efficient process;

    -> Desadvantage of litteral String:
        The string is unmutable: unmodifiable : if you do so, the other declared variable will be modified too.
