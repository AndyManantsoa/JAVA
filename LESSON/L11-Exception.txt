Exception handling:
___________________

Definitions:

-> Exception is an unwanted event which occurs at the run time of the program and break the normal flow of execution
-> Exception handling is a mechanism to handle the runtime errors throuh custom message

Advantages of Exception handling:
    -> it maintains the normal flow of program
    -> Parent class of all exception are all throwable class


                                   throwable
                              ___________________
                              |                  |
                        Exception              error
                        _________              ______
                    * checked exception          - Stackoverflow error
                    * Unchecked exeption         - error

-> Throwable class inherits mainly 2 childs exeption class known as exception and error
-> Exception class is inherited by checheck and unchecked exception's classes

1) Checked exception / compiletime exception:
    Exception which occurs at the compilation time of program.

ex: IO exception (while dealing with file)
    SQL exception
    ClassNotFound Exception

2) Unchecked exception / runtime exception:
    Exception which occurs bat the run time of the program

ex: Arithmetic exception
    NullPointer exception
    NumberFormat exception
    IndexOutOfBound exception:
        - ArrayOutOfBound exception
        - StringOutOfBound exeption

JAVA exception keywords:
    - try keyword is used to specify a block where the exception can occure 
    - catch keyword is a block used to handle the exception which occurs in the try block
    - finally is block which is used to execute important code of the program
              it execute weither the exeption is handled or not

    ex: try{

        } catch(Exception className){

        }
