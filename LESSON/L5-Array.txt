ARRAY:
-----

->Array is a container to store data;

->Initialization: 
1) int []arrayName = {};
2) int []arrayName = new dataType[size]; //object

-> .length is an in built function to find the size of an array.

-> advantage of array: optimization of code;

-> random acces: we can get the data which is located in the index;

-> Drawbacks of an array:
    fixed size so it cannot be changed once declared. size cannot grow dynamicaly

-> Types of array:
1) single dimensional array:
int []arrayName = new int[5];
2) multi dimensional array://row and collumn same
int [][]arrayName = new int[row][collumn];
3) jagged array
int [][]arrayName = new int[5][]; //array of array
