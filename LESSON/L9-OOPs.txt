OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING:

    step by step : procedural oriented approach.(in case of C)
    -> There was lagging: not flexible
                          no proper arrangement
                          time consuming

-> So, Object Oriented Programming was introduced:
    it is a rule to follow when we build scalable and flexible application.


OOP: is an approach by which we can design a program or application trully based on object and class

OPPS: (appoach) deals with real world entity

Advantages of OOP:
_________________

- flexibility: it is more flexible more than the procedural approach.
- high security: it is highly secured.
- reusability: it follows the dry principal (ie do not repeat)
- scalability: we can do versioning of the programs with the help of modules and structure given by the oops


CONCEPTS OF OOPs:
___________________

1. CLASSES:
    -> class is a blueprint or template or conctainer or a design pattern which is used to store the properties(instance variable) 
    and behaviors (function) of the resective object
    -> Class does not consum any space in the memory.
    * keyword: class ClassName(){
    }

2. OBJECT:
 Real world :
    -> Entity existing in the real world which has a physical existance and is surrounding us.
    -> Every objects will have properties and behaviors.

 In OOPS :
    -> object is an instance of a class
    * keyword: ClassName objectName = new ClassName();

3. INHERITANCE:
    -> inheritance is a mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties of another class.
    -> it is a process of creating a new class from an existing class.
    -> it is a way of creating a new class from an existing class.

4. ENCAPSULATION:
    -> encapsulation is a mechanism by which we can hide the internal details of an object from the
    outside world and only expose the necessary information to the outside world.   



5. POLYMORPHISM:
